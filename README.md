# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-Sentiment-Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
In this project, we present an innovative approach to stock market analysis by offering two distinctive functionalities:
1. **Real-time Sentiment Score Computation:** Utilizes VADER sentiment analysis to derive sentiment scores from news headlines, providing insights into market trends.
2. **Stock Price Prediction Using GAN & Twitter Sentiment Analysis:** Employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to analyze historical tweet data and stock prices for forecasting future stock trends.

This research-driven project aims to enrich the understanding of market dynamics, empowering investors to make data-driven decisions.

## üèó Methodology
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Score Computation
- **Data Collection:** News headlines sourced from FinViz.
- **Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** VADER model to compute sentiment scores.
- **Visualization:** Hourly & daily sentiment score graphs for stock analysis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Price Prediction Using GAN
- **Data Sources:** Historical tweets (from Kaggle) & stock data (from Yahoo Finance).
- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporating sentiment scores and technical indicators.
- **Model Implementation:**
  - Generator: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
  - Discriminator: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Training & Validation:** Backpropagation with loss function optimization.
- **Output:** Predicted vs. real stock price comparison.
